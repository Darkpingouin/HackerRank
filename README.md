# HackerRank


This are my attemps to answer the differents [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) challenges. If you are curious go take a look at my work.

I encourage you to try those challenges by yourself and not posting my code to solve it (it ruins the fun).

**Have fun you guys**

Each number corresponds to the number of solutions I provided for the given category. To find a soluton just take the name of the problem in `HackerRank` and transform it to CamelCase. 

Example : 
`Apple and Orange` becomes `AppleAndOrange`
